                    What does your local pool room, tavern or bar need to participate? Since everything is done via the internet then Wi-fi internet access for your customers required.
                    The full package deal would be a Kiosk station for the most value. The Kiosk stations are simple, come fully loaded, very affordable and ready to go.

                <p>
                    Behind the Rock (BTR) offers something different and new in the pool world. Whether it’s a local room, private club, bowling alley,
                    bar or tavern that may be full with leagues and/or tournaments or may have nothing to offer at all,
                    BTR can fit in to any schedule and runs on automatic. No league operator and no tournament director. So what we offer is an alternative to fill the void.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind the Rock Tour is a great addition and alternative to offer players.
                    BTR offers a format for any skill level. We have different divisions for different skilled players and an accurate
                    handicapping system that works like no other. The concept is all offense and acts as a grooming ladder for our sport.
                    This format will not only help fill the void for the players, but will fill the void for an activity in a small time window at the local establishment.
                    Not only will this format help fill the small windows of time for the room and the player, but it will help to teach players how to take their game to next level.
                    The format and tools we offer will help players isolate what they need to work on and where their strengths and weaknesses are.
                    Players will get rewarded for good play instead of being penalized. With the new Pro-Am Team pages players can now talk to their captain,
                    refer to the team page, get drills and new advice from the professional(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watching players play this format builds excitement in the room. Others will partake by pulling up a chair, have a beverage and wait for the outcome.
                    In addition to more play, the establishment receives online exposure through our website and local word of mouth advertising
                    because they are offering this unique format. Players can come to your room to play on a Pro-Am team and get advice from the pro captain.
                    The Captains will help guide your players and encourage them to practice and practice regularly.
                </p>

                    There is no weekly commitment for the players so it gives players the flexibility to compete,
                    but without a specific day and time commitment. For the those with family or other commitments,
                    time is critical. If players can come down, warm-up, play a match and get home to tuck the kids in that’s
                    two more hours of customers that might have just stay home that night. The format is great for players that
                    work during the week because it only takes about 45 minutes to an hour to play a match. For those players that have early mornings,
                    they can still fit in a tournament in his/her work week at the room pool.
                </p>
                <p>The benefits to the local room are the room can offer another reason for players to visit their establishment.
                    Players can practice or join the tournament in this format on their own or with their friends.
                    The location now has something more to offer and another reason for players to visit their establishment.
                    Players will want to practice or join the tournament in this format on their own or with their friends, set goals and have a target to shoot at.
                    Members can track their progress and statistics on the website to help in their growth. Of course, the more players in the room, means more revenue for
                    the establishment. Watching players play this format builds excitement in the room.</p>
