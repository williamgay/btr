                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Behind the Rock (BTR) is a weekly national, international or world tournament played remotely from any location, state or registered country at
                    locations with internet access like: pool rooms, bars, taverns, bowling alleys, clubs or even your home.
                    With the re-launch of the website we will be offering more games, more divisions and more formats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All games are played against the Ghost. This means players don’t have an opponent. It’s just you and the table.
                    You will break, take ball-in-hand and run balls according to the game rules until you foul, miss or run-out.
                    Once you do one of these three things that game is over. Most matches consist of 11 games, but some games may vary.
                </p>
                <h2>Tournaments</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a new tournament every week. You are not required to play every week, or you can play as many matches in as many games,
                    formats and divisions that you’re qualified to play in each week. Just remember you get back what you put in when it comes to working on your skills.

                <h2>Handicapping</h2>
                <p>
                    The two divisions for each game that are handicapped are: Intermediate and Open to All. When a new player starts they will participate in the
                    appropriate scratch division until they have completed 6 matches. Once 6 matches have been played (player must establish an average in each game
                    they choose to play), then the player will be moved to the appropriate handicapped division. Handicaps are calculated through a formula and are
                    calculated out to 1/100th of a point. This handicapping system is the most accurate in the industry. Players will compete for prize money even when
                    they are playing in the Scratch division for their first 6 matches. The purpose of the handicap is not to make it impossible for the more skilled players
                    to win or easy for the less skilled player to win, but to reward the players that have a great performance no matter what their skill level.
                    This handicap system levels the playing field and creates competition that may not be best player that wins an event, but it could be.
                    The player that brings their “A” game in a particular week is who will usually earn a piece of the prize fund. If you don’t want to play handicapped
                    then you can jump in and play in the Professional division which will be scratch with equipment criteria.

                    PRO-AM TEAMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BTR has 16 professional Team Captains. Each team will have their own Team webpage that only their team has access to.
                    The Captains and/or Assistant Captains of each team will mentor the players on their team with the chat room, drills, videos or whatever tools
                    they choose to use for their team to achieve success. Throughout the year we will have Pro-Am events where there will be no divisions,
                    but handicaps will be used. These events will be fun and exciting for all. There will be a minimum number of matches that the players will have to
                    play within a certain time period to participate in these events. We will have other surprise events with the Pros as well.
                    Your team captain may choose to run a team only competition for $ and/or prizes.
                </p>
